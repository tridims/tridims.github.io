## What is Github Pages ?

Github pages is a service from github for hosting a static web pages. This service work by saving the html, javascript, and css directly to github repository and use it to built the website.

Github pages is free, but we can only create one github pages per account. When we create github pages we will get default domain that is username.github.io

## What is Jekyll ?

Jekyll is one of static website generator that was written on ruby. It is pretty popular, and one of the reason is because github support/using it.

Static website generator is a module/library that can create static website from and usually markdown file. It works by converting markdown file to html and apply some theme that we choose.

Jekyll is the kind of static website generator that Github can work with automatically. And by that i mean github can compile or run jekyll in the repository itself to create the website. This is different from other. When we use other static website generator for creating Github Pages, we must run the library and save the html, css, and javascript ourselves then we can put it on the repository.

Jekyll is written on ruby, and we must install ruby and gem to use this library.
